# Command and Scripting Interpreter: Unix Shell [id: .004]
# Adversaries may abuse Unix shell commands and scripts for execution. 
# Unix shells are the primary command prompt on Linux and macOS systems. 
# though many variations of the Unix shell exist (e.g. sh, bash, zsh, etc.) depending on the specific OS or distribution. 
# Unix shells can control every aspect of a system, with certain commands requiring elevated privileges.

- rule: Detect Unix shell interpreter
  desc: Attempts to detect a Command and Scripting Interpreter such as Unix Shell
  condition: (proc.name=sh or proc.name=bash or proc.name=zsh or proc.name=ash) and (evt.type=execve or evt.type=execvp)
  output: "Unix shell interpreter (sh, bash, zsh, ash) detected in process name=%proc.name command=%proc.cmdline"
  priority: WARNING

# This rule checks for the process names "sh", "bash", "zsh", "ash" and for the events "execve" or "execvp"
#
# execve() executes the program referred to by pathname. (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html
# This causes the program that is currently being run by the calling process to be replaced with a new program
# In this case, it's replaced with a newly initialized stack, heap, and (initialized and uninitialized) data segments.
#
# execvp() function replaces the current process image with a new process image specified by file. 
# The new image is constructed from a regular, executable file called the new process image file. 
# No return is made because the calling process image is replaced by the new process image.
# (https://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/6.5.0SP1.update/com.qnx.doc.neutrino_lib_ref/e/execvp.html)
#
# This way it can detect the use of a Unix shell interpreter. 
# If a match is found, the rule will output a warning message with the process name and command line arguments used.
